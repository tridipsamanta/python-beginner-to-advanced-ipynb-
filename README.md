## 1️⃣ Introduction to Python

Python is a **high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed, and object-oriented programming language**. It is known for its **simple syntax**, **readability**, and **wide range of applications** such as web development, data science, AI, automation, and scripting.

### Key Features

* Easy to learn and use
* Platform independent
* Large standard library
* Supports multiple programming paradigms
* Open-source and community driven

---

## 2️⃣ Python Installation & Environment

This section explains how Python can be installed on different operating systems, what an interpreter is, and the role of IDEs and code editors. It also covers virtual environments and package managers conceptually.

---

## 3️⃣ Python Syntax & Keywords

Covers Python’s indentation-based syntax, reserved keywords, statements, and rules that define how Python programs are written and executed.

---

## 4️⃣ Variables & Identifiers

Explains how variables store data, naming rules for identifiers, dynamic typing, and memory reference behavior in Python.

---

## 5️⃣ Data Types in Python

Detailed explanation of built-in data types:

* Numeric types
* Boolean type
* Text type
* Sequence types
* Set types
* Mapping type
* None type

Also discusses mutability vs immutability.

---

## 6️⃣ Type Conversion (Type Casting)

Explains implicit and explicit type conversion, why casting is needed, and common scenarios where it is used.

---

## 7️⃣ Operators in Python

Covers all operator categories:

* Arithmetic operators
* Relational operators
* Logical operators
* Assignment operators
* Bitwise operators
* Membership operators
* Identity operators

---

## 8️⃣ Input & Output Concepts

---

## 9️⃣ Conditional Statements

Covers decision-making logic using conditions, comparison, nested decisions, and flow control concepts.

---

## 🔟 Looping Statements

Explains repetitive execution using loops, loop control flow, nested loops, and logical flow tracing.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Control Statements

Describes loop control keywords, their purpose, and how they alter the normal flow of execution.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Pattern Logic Concepts

Focuses on understanding pattern logic, iteration flow, row-column relationships, and logical thinking rather than syntax.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Strings in Python

Explains string properties, immutability, indexing, slicing, common operations, and built-in string methods conceptually.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Lists in Python

Explains tuple properties, immutability, use cases, and comparison with lists.

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Sets in Python

Covers unordered collections, uniqueness, set operations, and mathematical set concepts.

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Dictionaries in Python

Explains key-value mapping, dictionary properties, common operations, methods, and real-world use cases.

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ Functions in Python

Covers function concepts such as definition, calling, parameters, arguments, return values, scope, and reusability.

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ Recursion

Explains recursive logic, base case, recursive case, advantages, disadvantages, and when recursion should be used.

---

## 2️⃣0️⃣ Lambda Functions

Describes anonymous functions, use cases, limitations, and where they are commonly applied.
